# AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial Application

## Overview
Traing on this small application to move it from Bower & Angular1 to Webpact4 before I do the same in the massive work project.

## Step took:
- Take a Really Deep Breath...
- Add lowdash to the build to represent a dependency that cannot be move to npm yet (custom module) via Bower.
- Install webpack & webpack-cli & add the basic configuration file.
- Break everything
- Move the Bower dependency to a NPM/Package.js dependency.
- Converting the module from src to import.
- Add webpack-dev-server to serve / follow the progress.
